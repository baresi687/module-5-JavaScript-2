// So best case, we have an array of a million integers or 50 integers.
//
// The very best case is that we find the thing we're looking for right away
//
// So that's the best possible scenario, right?
//
// That's pretty rare.

// O(1)  BEST


//
// The worst case is O of N.
// O(N) THE WORST

// So if we have a million integers in an array,
// and we're searching for the last one,
// or we're searching for something
// that's not in there,
// we're going to have to look
// a million times if we have 50 things
